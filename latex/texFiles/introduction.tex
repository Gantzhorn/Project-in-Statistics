\subsection*{Hidden markov models in ecology}
We use hidden markov model a model that allows us to model how a specific system changes over time. The model consists of two stochastic processes: the state- and the observation process. The state process corresponds to the distinct states an animal can have i.e. resting, flying, hunting etc., whereas the observation state corresponds to the altitude of the animal, its distance travelled since last observation etc.
